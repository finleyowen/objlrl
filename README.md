# Objective Language Recognition Library (`objlrl`)

The Objective Language Recognition Library (`objlrl`) is for lexing and parsing computer languages in C++. Importantly, 'objective' in the project name refers to the design of the library itself, not to the types of languages it can recognise. The library is not restrained to recognising object-oriented languages, but the code that you (the compiler engineer) use to interact with `objlrl` is object-oriented (C++) code.
